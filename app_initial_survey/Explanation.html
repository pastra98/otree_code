<h1>Description</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p><strong>Welcome to the experiment!</strong></p>

<p>You are a citizen living in a bigger city somewhere in the world.
The city wants to give engaged citizens like you the option to notify
them about problems that you encounter in everyday life through a mobile
application.</p>

<p>You're using this application today and based on your contributions and
those of others, the city you live in will be able to work on your
reported issues. The more reports you and your peers contribute, the
more the city improves.</p>

<p>Please read the information on this page carefully because your
comprehension will be tested.</p>

<h2>The setting</h2>

<p>You and the other participants may submit certain reports that we have
already created for you. Every participant will receive between 4 and 6
effort points. These effort points resemble the amount of effort that
you would put into a report on your app, when encountering a problem in
your city. You will receive points at the end, based on your individual
contribution and based on how much effort other participants put into
their submission.</p>

<p>The underlying mechanism of points generation will be the same for
everyone. You will play 7 rounds, every round is a clean slate where you
can only spend the effort points you are provided with.</p>

<h2>The Decision</h2>

<p>You can decide to submit between 0 and 4 effort points per submission.
Every effort point put into the submission will make the submission
clearer for the city, and thus increase the likelihood of the problem
being remedied. You have to make this decision without any form of
communication with other participants.</p>

<h2>The Consequences</h2>

<p>You and other participants earn extra points for every submitted report about an issue. A group of 4 players contributes to a shared pot that will be distributed. All the points that you chose not to submit will be added together with those extra points from the shared pot. This is called your "payout" and it is calculated in the following way:</p>

<p>payout = Initial effort points - Your contribution + (total
contribution by other participants / 4) * 1.5)</p>

<p>This means that every effort point spent on good reports will be worth
50% more once distributed among the participants.</p>

<p>After you and the other participants have made your decision, you will
be presented with your payout, as well as some additional information.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>(1) After the comprehension questions, we will ask you to rank
yourself from 1 to 10 based on your monthly available income.</p>

<p>(2) Afterwards you will be presented with an issue found in your city,
to which you can dedicate effort points from 0 (no submission) to 4
effort points (full submission). Based on your spending, the quality of
the submission will be higher and thus make the issue clearer to the
city.</p>
