    <p>
    The game is played over 7 rounds. In each round you will first receive effort points
    that you can spend on reports. You can decide to choose between reports that cost
    0 to 4 effort points. Once everyone of your 3 group members has submitted a report:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            the <b>value of all your reports is summed up</b>. this is the total
            contribution of your group
        </li>
        <li>
            the total contribution is divided by 4, such that everyone gets to profit from
            all the reports submitted. Furthermore, the total contribution is increased by 50%,
            in order to reward participants for sharing their reports. This means that
            <b>the total points are multiplied by 1.5</b> before they are redistributed.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    The effort points you receive at the end of the round thus depend on the overall
    quality of reports in your group, as well as the effort points you chose to keep
    for yourself. This is called your "payout", and this formula again shows how your
    payout is calculated:
    </p>

    <script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
    <script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
        <p>
            $$\text{payout} = \text{Initial effort points} - \text{Your contribution} + \left( \frac{\text{total contributions in group}}{4} \right) \times 1.5$$
        </p>

    <p>
    The rules will be the same for everyone in your group. The effort points are
    not carried over between rounds, every round is a clean slate where you
    can only spend the effort points you are provided with. You have to decide how much
    effort you want to put into your reports without communicating with others.
    </p>
