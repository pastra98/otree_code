Imagine a ladder with 10 steps. At the top of the ladder (step 10) are the
people who are the best off - those who have the most money, highest level
of education, and best jobs. At the bottom of the ladder (step 0) are the
people who are the worst off - those who have the least money, least education,
worst jobs, or no job at all.

Please choose a step on the ladder to indicate where you think you stand
in comparison to the other participants of this experiment:
