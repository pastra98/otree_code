<p>
You are a citizen living in a city somewhere in the world.
The city wants to give engaged citizens like you the option to contribute to improving the city by notifying
city officials about all kinds of infrastructure related issues through a mobile app.
</p>

<p>
You're using this application today to report issues. Based on your contributions and
those of others, the city you live in will be able to work on your
reported issues. The better the reports are that you and your peers contribute, the
more the city improves.

We will simulate this application via a simple economic game.
</p>

<h3>The game</h3>

<p>
You will be placed in a group with 3 other classmates. Everyone of you receives
a certain amount of points which you can choose to spend to produce an issue report.
The focus here lies on the quality of the report, spending more points allows you
to produce a better report - think of these points as the effort you would put into
reporting a real-life issue in your city.

The rules for how this game works will be explained on the following page. You will
also be asked to answer 3 questions about the rules in order to proceed.
